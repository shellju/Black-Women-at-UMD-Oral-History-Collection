## About the Collection

This collection of oral histories, their recordings, transcripts, and images, is focused on the experiences of Black women who attended and/or worked at the University of Maryland (UMD), College Park. The interviews discuss topics ranging from family life, to school work, politics, the chartering of the Alpha Kappa Sorority at UMD, and more. UMD Professor Elsa Barkley Brown began this oral history project in 2017, and she and students continue to interview and document the lives of Black women at UMD to this day. This collection currently features nine interviews from 2017-2020.

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
